### Computer assembled according to the "Bean" principle of the Spring Framework

***Description:***

This example demonstrates how easy it is to design large programs using Spring technology. 
In a separate configuration file, all program components are pre-installed, 
and then a whole object is assembled with one line of code for later use.

***How to use:***

Create the "Main" class run configuration in your IDE and start the program.
Familiarize yourself with the Spring configuration class.
Please note that the program uses the principle of building
a Spring configuration through a Java class,
not the outdated configuration method using an XML file.

***Tools used:***

Java <br/>
Maven <br/>
Spring Framework <br/>
